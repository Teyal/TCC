My conclusion graduation thesis with all the code and things related to it.

grover-sat is the main folder, with there being the crossover and nighlty folders using poetry to run ket 0.3.3 and 0.4.0 respectively. 
results contains the final images used in the thesis.
DPLL-SAT-solver-master is a copy of another git.
The sats.csv file is the generated sats used.

octave folder is not related to the final thesis, but was implemented in the context so it will be kept.
